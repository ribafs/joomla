Criando um site estático de um site dinâmico

wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites \
--no-parent http://example.org



The command line, in short…

wget -k -K -E -r -l 10 -p -N -F --restrict-file-names=windows -nH http://website.com/

…and the options explained

    -k : convert links to relative
    -K : keep an original versions of files without the conversions made by wget
    -E : rename html files to .html (if they don’t already have an htm(l) extension)
    -r : recursive… of course we want to make a recursive copy
    -l 10 : the maximum level of recursion. if you have a really big website you may need to put a higher number, but 10 levels should be enough.
    -p : download all necessary files for each page (css, js, images)
    -N : Turn on time-stamping.
    -F : When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML file.
    -nH : By default, wget put files in a directory named after the site’s hostname. This will disabled creating of those hostname directories and put everything in the current directory.
    –restrict-file-names=windows : may be useful if you want to copy the files to a Windows PC.
