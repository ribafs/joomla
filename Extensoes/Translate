For translating extensions for Joomla! 1.6, 1.7, 2.5 (partially for Joomla! 3.5) see this article: Creating language packs for extensions in Joomla 2.5

This article describes how to create translation for Joomla! specific extension. As example we will build Czech language for Phoca Gallery component.

1) We will prepare folder structure for the new created translation. Create the following folders on your disc:

    lang/admin
    lang/site

Open text editor and paste there the following content:

<html><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"></body></html>

 

Save it as index.html in both folders (as lang/admin/index.html and lang/site/index.html).

2) Unzip the Phoca Gallery component ZIP file somewhere on your disc. Go to:

    language/en-GB/ folder (which is included in the unzipped Phoca Gallery structure)

and open both files:

    en-GB.com_phocagallery.ini
    en-GB.com_phocagallery.menu.ini

in text editor. Translate the strings to your langauge and save them as (in our example we use Czech prefixes):

    lang/admin/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.ini
    lang/admin/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.menu.ini
    lang/site/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.ini
    lang/site/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.menu.ini

Files should be saved as UTF-8 without BOM encoding.

3) Open text editor and paste there the following content:

<install type="language" version="3" client="both" method="upgrade">
	<name>cs-CZ.com_phocagallery</name>
	<tag>cs-CZ</tag>
	<creationDate>17/05/2018</creationDate>
	<author>Jan Pavelka</author>
	<authorEmail></authorEmail>
	<authorUrl>https://www.phoca.cz</authorUrl>

	<description>Czech language pack for Phoca Gallery</description>

<administration>
    <files folder="admin">
  		<filename>cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.ini</filename>
  		<filename>cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.menu.ini</filename>		
  		<filename>index.html</filename>
    </files>
  </administration>
  
  <site>
    <files folder="site">
  		<filename>cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.ini</filename>
  		<filename>cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.menu.ini</filename>		
  		<filename>index.html</filename>
  	</files>
  </site>
</install>

Edit it and ave it as :

    lang/install.xml file.

So now you should have the following folder structure in the folder lang:

 

    install.xml
    admin/index.html
    admin/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.ini
    admin/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.menu.ini
    site/index.html
    site/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.ini
    site/cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.menu.ini

Select all files included in lang folder and add them into ZIP file called lang-prefix-LANG-PREFIX.com_phocagallery.zip (in our example the file will have the following name: cs-CZ.com_phocagallery.zip)

Now the translation is ready and can be installed via standard Joomla! installation procedure.

How to install language pack in Joomla!
Navigation
• •

Some component language packs cannot be installed in Extension Manager (e.g. because they don't include XML setup file). In such case, they need to be installed manually.

See the following example (German language pack for Phoca Gallery component), how to install language pack manually:

Download German language ZIP pack and unzip it. You should get two files:

    de-DE.com_phocagallery.ini
    de-DE.com_phocagallery.menu.ini

Copy both files into the following destination:

    administrator/language/de-DE/ folder and
    language/de-DE/ folder on your server.

If the German language is active (admin, front) on your Joomla! site, then the Phoca Gallery component will be translated to German.
