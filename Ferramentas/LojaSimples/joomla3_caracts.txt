Joomla 3.2.3
What made Joomla a better CMS in 2014, the final truth...

Patrick Toulze Art Director, founder — Directeur artistique, fondateur at Graf Web & Marketing

Old concepts can become facts and CMS get caught, as everything else in the same pattern. Obviously you need to take time to verify if they are myths or facts.

I know and work with multiple CMS, like Concrete, Wordpress and obviously Joomla. I build ONLY with Joomla for my customers because I care.

I don’t want to target Wordpress to be less or more but I want to put things straight in this old rivalry between 2 excellent CMS.

JOOMLA OUT OF THE BOX
